<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Pia is a pharmacist-in-training who sets up shop in Port Fina. She has high hopes for curing the townspeople of a rare disease, but ends up biting off more than she can chew, prompting her to seek training in combat, magic, crafting, and pretty much every subject that could aid her in being a shopkeeper.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
<h3>Combat Role</h3>
<p>Pia's strong stats are MAG and DEF while her weak stats are her AGI and CRI. She can equip any weapon type and has decent ATK, but it pays off for the player more in the long run to play Pia as a mage due to her Hyper Special and her ability to learn spells from all elements except Light, Dark, Ruin, and Life. To that end, you may want get her element graph changed in order to match your playstyle.</p><p>Pia's Hyper Special <strong>Essentia</strong>, surrounds her with elemental projectiles for a few moments before doubling her MAG stat for a short time and allowing her to ignore Element Graph restrictions. During this time, you should try to unleash as many spells as you can before the buff wears off or before you activate her Finisher. Speaking of which, her Finisher, <strong>Element Zero</strong>, unleashes a volley of elemental projectiles at nearby enemies before damaging all enemies on the screen.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Marinet is an amnesiac doll who suddenly approaches Ellevark in order to spur him to save Port Fina, but is rejected. She then teams up with Pia to find a cure, only for the latter to fall sick, forcing her to try to convince Ellevark again. Due to Ellevark's tardiness in taking action and due to his own distrust towards her, Marinet refuses to work with him until Pia convinces the two to make up.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
    <h3>Combat Role</h3>
    <p>Marinet has the highest MAG and RES of the party, as well as surprisingly high BLO, but has low or average stats everywhere else. When she starts as a guest character, she doesn't remember how to use magic, but once she learns it, she becomes a powerful offensive and healing caster, though her spells all have long casting time. If she's an AI ally, you can unequip her bow to force her AI to only use magic, but she'll be a sitting duck if she gets silenced, since a weapon is required to use a basic physical combo.
  </p>
  <p>Marinet's Hyper Special is <strong>Quartet</strong>, which causes her to quadruple an offensive spell upon casting it. Her Finisher <strong>Big Bang</strong>, deals multiple hits of Ruin damage to the entire screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike most of the other characters, Marinet's recruitment duel is optional, likely due to its difficulty. It should still be doable if you take advantage of her weaknesses and watch out for her Hyper Special. Just think of all the power at your disposal if you manage to win!

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Ellevark is a Celestial, a person with both human and godly blood, allowing him to live far longer than humans. Unfortunately, his slow aging caused many of his human peers to persecute him, turning him into a jaded man who holes up on the Faraway Continent. After being prodded by Marinet and seeing Pia's determination to save the people of Port Fina, Ellevark's altruistic side is rewawakened, prompting him to complete the cure to Port Fever and to take Pia as an apprentice.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
<h3>Combat Role</h3>
<p>It's not apparent at first due to Ellevark starting at a higher level than everyone else, but he has his strengths and weaknesses too. He has excellent ATK and HP, with all of his other stats being average or slightly below average. To take advantage of this, he has a wide variety of weapon-based skills, allowing him to mow down enemies without spending too much MP. That said, you shouldn't neglect his magic, since he can learn plenty of Light, Dark, Ruin, and Life spells, giving him a skillset that complements Pia's skillset. He does have spells from the other six elements, but he can only use their level 3 spells and the crystones won't change his levels for those elements. Since he's one of the few healers, you'll want to rely more on his spells and MP potions to stay alive than healing potions for the sake of Cost efficiency, though you'll have to make sure to get used to the game's targeting system.</p>
<p>His Hyper Special, <strong>Imagined World</strong>, causes several barrages of elemental projectiles to rain down on foes, which could be useful for Balance Breaking an enemy. His Finisher, <strong>Big Crunch</strong>, simply deals massive Ruin elemental damage to a wide area, possibly stretching beyond the screen.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Karnel is a skilled alchemist and an old friend of Ellevark who managed to become one of Erance's Court Alchemists through constant hard work. Unfortunately, the government gave him the nigh-impossible assignment of making a Philosopher's Stone, causing him to burn out and lose a lot of his confidence. This, along with news that Finstaria is under attack by poisonous spores, causes him to resign and join Pia's party.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
<h3>Combat Role</h3>
<p>Karnel has high DEX and AGI, low MAG and MP, and average stats in everything else. His lack of magic power isn't too much of an issue, since his skillset has no standard offensive spells and instead focuses on status ailments, status buffs, and situational attacks. Many of his skills have high BP consumption, so it helps to give him equipment with BP stabilizing effects.
</p>
<p>His Hyper Special is <strong>Taboo Grimoire</strong>, which removes cast and delay time from his skills, as well as activating a Grimoire-type book's effects 100% of the time, though the last effect is canceled if you switch books. His Finisher, <strong>Dark Casting Circle</strong>, deals Dark damage to all enemies on screen and Balance Breaks non-boss enemies.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Erena is the illegitimate daughter of the head of the Franlight family and a commoner. After a shady character tells her that her father's still alive, Erena attempts to sneak into Erance castle to meet her father by lying about having intel on the Faraway Continent. In response, a noble uses his or her connections to mark Erena for execution, leading to the party saving and recruiting her.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
<h3>Combat Role</h3>
<p>Erena has high ATK, MAG, and DEX, but somewhat low RES and AGI, and low MP. This means she's one of the best offensive party members, but also vulnerable to magic and may need a lot of MP potions for long battles. In addition to her fire spells, she also has several sword skills, some of which can chain to her standard 3-hit combo. Later in the game, she'll learn a skill that can negate fire damage to herself, making her ideal for taking on bosses that focus on that element.
</p>
<p>Erena's Hyper Special is <strong>Flame Whirlwind</strong>, which increases the range of her physical attacks while giving them the fire element and allowing them to burn non-boss enemies 100% of the time. Her Finisher, <strong>Scarlotus Petal</strong>, deals both physical and magical damage to all enemies on the screen.

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mimi is a shopkeeper who lives alone in the snowy village of Northyne, who aids the party after a teleportation mishap causes them to arrive in village outskirts by accident. She's very polite and mature for her age, but is also resigned to a rather grim fate, one that the party can prevent.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
    <h3>Combat Role</h3>
    <p>Mimi has the second best MAG stat, but has low DEF, DEX, BLO, and HP. However, her high AGI increases her chance of automatically dodging physical attacks, which makes up for her lack of durability. In addition to her ice spells, she has skills that can summon various creatures to aid her in battle, but at the cost of constantly consuming her MP until the skill is canceled. Her Summon Moby skill in particular is one of the few sources of AOE healing available.
  </p>
  <p>Mimi's Hyper Special is <strong>Ancient Dragon</strong>, which increases her movement speed and alters her standard physical attack. Her Finisher <strong>Eternal Breath</strong>, is a wide, line-based AOE attack.
